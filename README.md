# Car Rental System (Java OOP Project)

This project is a **console-based Car Rental System** developed using **pure Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**.  
It simulates a simple real-world car rental workflow, allowing users to rent cars, manage customers, and calculate rental costs efficiently.

---

## Key Features
- Rent available cars through a console-based interface
- Generate a confirmation slip after successful booking
- Calculate rental charges based on:
  - Car type
  - Rental duration
- Manage cars, customers, and rental records effectively

---

## OOP Concepts Used
This project is designed to demonstrate **all four pillars of OOP**:

- **Encapsulation** – Data and logic are wrapped inside well-defined classes  
- **Inheritance** – Different car types extend common car behavior  
- **Polymorphism** – Same operations behave differently for different car types  
- **Abstraction** – Core functionality is exposed while hiding internal details  

---

## Project Structure
The system is implemented using the following classes:

- `Car` – Represents car details and rental information  
- `Customer` – Stores customer-related data  
- `Rental` – Handles rental transactions  
- `CarRentalSystem` – Controls the overall flow of the application  

Data is managed using **ArrayList**, making the system dynamic and easy to extend.
